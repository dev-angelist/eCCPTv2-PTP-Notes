\
The path to becoming a penetration tester is like a winding river, ever-changing and unpredictable. To navigate it, one must be adaptable, resourceful, and always willing to learn.

The journey to becoming a penetration tester is a lifelong one. It is a journey of continuous learning, discovery, and self-improvement.

I will try to indicate the path I used and which I would recommend to reach a level necessary to pass the exam. 👇
